### Finding a Project

There are many things to consider when evaluating a project for participation. Initial impressions are important (this looks awesome!), but so too is critical review for 'fit'. Not all projects accommodate new contributors, not all project maintainers are responsive - but may do, and are.

Open Source is a great opportunity to learn by doing - understanding through experience. In this chapter, you'll learn about the three primary ways people get involved with open projects - with an opportunity to explore for yourself.

#### Via Personal or Pro-Bono Projects

![tracks]({{site.baseurl}}/img/building.jpg)

Many, many developers, designers, writers and other skilled contributors find open projects through the work they are already doing either in their careers, or related to hobbies.

For example, a developer working with [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org) or [Drupal](http://drupal.org) for an company, or in pro-bono for a non-profit,  work might fix a known bug, or realize that a small change they've made for a client is probably something others would want. **A first contribution often happens this way: through the experience of working-with, or using a open source project.**

Benefits of making a first contribution via real-world use of a project/product are:

* You learn in a safe environment(your project sandbox), how things like pull requests work, how to merge code, how to create tasks without fear of being judged in real-time.
* You can make something thats really needed - it solves a problem, or helps someone achieve something not otherwise possible.
* You're practicing being a maintainer as well as a contributor.
* Your contribution can help others working on similar use cases (i.e. higher education, campus issues) - you'll likely meet people interested in the same things you are.

#### Open Project Searches

Many, people search for open projects with technology relevant to their interests and career goals.

There are numerous ways you can find an open project including ['Up for Grabs'](http://up-for-grabs.net), [Github](https://github.com/explore/), [Bugs Ahoy](https://www.joshmatthews.net/bugsahoy/?a11y=1&simple=1) and [Your First PR](https://yourfirstpr.github.io/) and there is also Github's ['trending repos'](https://github.com/trending) which allow you to see what projects are most popular right now. In this way you can window-shop for opportunities and tasks that feel manageable, (and hopefully) interesting and fun.

The benefits of this approach are:

* You can select a project by the skill you want to learn.
* There's opportunity to apply our checklist(below)to assess - avoiding hostile, inactive or unresponsive communities.
* You can look for projects with people you hope to meet, or have been inspired by in some way.
* If you don't like that project, it's easier to step away than if you have a work project reliant on the outcome.

#### Changing the World -  HFOSS

![tracks]({{site.baseurl}}/img/hands.jpg)

As part of your **[Open Source Career Map](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u8G3cTYVBrSWcUIaU_m7Xixr3wlDS3rlBL4HvCzoPPw/edit#)** assignment in [module 1](http://127.0.0.1:4000/learning-open-source/articles/open-is-an-attitude/opening-your-future/), you were have been asked to think about your motivations for contributing to an Open Project. Enter HFOSS - or simply Humanitarian Open Source.

A great way to select a project is by connecting to a cause that you feel connected to and passionate about.

> Digital humanitarian communities vary in size, structure, and focus. There are well-established groups like [Sahana Foundation](https://sahanafoundation.org/) or [Ushahidi](http://sahanafoundation.org/), as well as the growing [Digital Humanitarian Network](http://digitalhumanitarians.com/). Each of these organizations, and many more digital communities, seek your expertise.  - [Getting Involved with HFOSS](https://opensource.com/life/15/2/getting-involved-hfoss), [Heather Leeson](https://opensource.com/users/hleson).

### Ways to contribute
Although a first pull request is often championed as the milestone for contribution - it's not fair to say that this is the ultimate goal, or should be for any contributor.  Many things can happen before that first PR that end up as contributions.

Reporting a bug, updating a README file, helping another contributor, QA,  writing a blog post, designing a logo, updating a wiki, translation  are all first-contributions, and also great ways to contribute.
